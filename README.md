Hello World!
About me:
I am a technology leader-by-day turned activist-by-night with a passion for leaving the world a better place than I found it. I am a self-described motivator, sky reacher, and over-achiever. I started my 20+ year technology career writing Java applets and desktop applications in C++ and I now manage large technology programs for a healthcare analytics company.

Initially an advocate for the brain tumor community and women and girls in STEM, my activism kicked into high gear following the 2016 Presidential election when I was one of the co-founders of the Womenâ€™s March on Philadelphia. This life changing experience opened my eyes to the social and economic injustices that are rampant in America today. I ran for Philadelphia City Council at Large in the 2019 primary. I now serve as President of Pennsylvania NOW, on the Boards of Americans for Democratic Action SE PA Chapter and the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society, and on the Steering Committees for the Philadelphia Public Banking Coalition and Philly for Change, an affiliate of Democracy for America.

I live with my partner Robert in Philadelphia just a few blocks from the Liberty Bell and I love reading everything I can get my hands on, meeting new people, and being the best aunt in the world.
